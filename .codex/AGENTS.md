# Code Butler Agent Instructions

- Use this repo root as context: `/Users/edmundengland/Documents/coding_tools/code_butler`.
- Follow `openspec/AGENTS.md` for proposal/change/spec conventions; treat those rules as authoritative.
- Keep edits confined to the requested files/specs; do not touch other files unless explicitly required.
- When running Codex commands, prefer absolute paths and never substitute missing files with other specs.
