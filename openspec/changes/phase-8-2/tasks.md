## 1. Deliverables

- [ ] Enforce that each `CleanupPlan` addresses **one concern**:

  - [ ] One helper extraction,
  - [ ] One file split,
  - [ ] One small file group move,
  - [ ] One docstring batch for a small scope,
  - [ ] One advanced cleanup suggestion.

- [ ] This keeps each Butler spec and Codex call small and deterministic.
