## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 6.2 – Git Branch Management
The ai-clean project MUST fulfill the deliverables for Phase 6.2 described in docs/butlerspec_plan.md to keep the ButlerSpec roadmap on track.

#### Scenario: Phase 6.2 complete
- **GIVEN** the team is executing 6 – Git Safety & Storage Utilities
- **WHEN** Phase 6.2 (Git Branch Management) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides git branch management outputs covering: Implement `ensure_on_refactor_branch(base_branch, refactor_branch)`:; No auto-commits or merges into `main`. Conflicts are surfaced to user.
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
