## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 7.8 – `/changes-review` Command

- **WHEN** Phase 7.8 (`/changes-review` Command) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides `/changes-review` command outputs covering: `ai-clean changes-review PLAN_ID`:
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
