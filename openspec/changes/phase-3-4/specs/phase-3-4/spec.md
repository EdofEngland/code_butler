## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 3.4 – Planner for Organize Candidates
The ai-clean project MUST fulfill the deliverables for Phase 3.4 described in docs/butlerspec_plan.md to keep the ButlerSpec roadmap on track.

#### Scenario: Phase 3.4 complete
- **GIVEN** the team is executing 3 – Planner (Findings → CleanupPlans)
- **WHEN** Phase 3.4 (Planner for Organize Candidates) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides planner for organize candidates outputs covering: For `organize_candidate`:; Each `CleanupPlan` moves only a **small set** of files.
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
