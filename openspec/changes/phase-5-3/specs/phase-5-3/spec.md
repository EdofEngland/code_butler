## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 5.3 – ReviewExecutor: Codex-Powered Changes Review
The ai-clean project MUST fulfill the deliverables for Phase 5.3 described in docs/butlerspec_plan.md to keep the ButlerSpec roadmap on track.

#### Scenario: Phase 5.3 complete
- **GIVEN** the team is executing 5 – Executors (Codex + Review)
- **WHEN** Phase 5.3 (ReviewExecutor: Codex-Powered Changes Review) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides reviewexecutor: codex-powered changes review outputs covering: Implement a `ReviewExecutor` for `/changes-review`:; No code modifications here—review only.
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
