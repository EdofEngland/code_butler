## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 5.1 – CodexShellExecutor: Apply Spec with Shell Wrapper
The ai-clean project MUST fulfill the deliverables for Phase 5.1 described in docs/butlerspec_plan.md to keep the ButlerSpec roadmap on track.

#### Scenario: Phase 5.1 complete
- **GIVEN** the team is executing 5 – Executors (Codex + Review)
- **WHEN** Phase 5.1 (CodexShellExecutor: Apply Spec with Shell Wrapper) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides codexshellexecutor: apply spec with shell wrapper outputs covering: Implement `CodexShellExecutor` as a `CodeExecutor`:; This preserves your **Codex integration** while making the spec system fully yours.
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
