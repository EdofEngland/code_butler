## 1. Deliverables

- [ ] For `advanced_cleanup`:

  - [ ] Intent: Implement a single, small Codex-suggested improvement.

  - [ ] Examples:

    - [ ] Simplify conditional.
    - [ ] Standardize naming within module.
    - [ ] Remove obviously dead code in a narrow scope.

  - [ ] Constraints:

    - [ ] Local change only (small patch).
    - [ ] Limit number of files + total changed lines.

- [ ] Plans should be **review-friendly**: small, self-contained.
