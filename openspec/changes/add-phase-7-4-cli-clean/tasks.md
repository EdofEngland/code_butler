## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Filter analyzer output to duplicate_block, large_file, and long_function for the clean flow.
  - [ ] 1.1.1 Implement `ai_clean/cli_clean.py` (or handler in `cli.py`) that runs `analyze_repo(path)` and filters findings by the allowed categories.
  - [ ] 1.1.2 Group findings by category and display concise summaries (id, description, location) so users can choose targets.
- [ ] 1.2 Prompt user selection and create corresponding plans.
  - [ ] 1.2.1 Provide an interactive prompt (e.g., numeric menu) or `--auto` flag; allow selecting multiple findings but cap the count (e.g., max 3 plans).
  - [ ] 1.2.2 For each selected finding, call `plan_from_finding(..., config=config)` and show the generated plan id/title; store them via the new storage helper.
- [ ] 1.3 Ask whether to apply immediately or store for later.
  - [ ] 1.3.1 After plan creation, prompt “Apply now?” per plan; when confirmed, call the same apply routine as `/apply` (reuse helper function).
  - [ ] 1.3.2 When user declines, print the plan path and exit without changing files; ensure no git actions occur unless the user opts in.
  - [ ] 1.3.3 Add unit tests (mocking `input()` and the orchestrators) verifying selection filtering, plan generation, and conditional apply behavior.
