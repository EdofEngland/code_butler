## Why
Turn docstring findings into concise documentation improvement plans.

## What Changes
- For missing_docstring and weak_docstring findings, create plans to add or improve factual docstrings.
- Steps analyze existing behavior, draft concise docstrings, and insert or replace without behavior changes.
- Constrain plans to a module or small cluster of related symbols.

## Impact
- Ensures documentation work is scoped and behavior-neutral.
- Plans avoid renames or new promises.
