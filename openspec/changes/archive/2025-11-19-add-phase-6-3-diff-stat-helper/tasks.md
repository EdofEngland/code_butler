## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Call git diff --stat to produce summary output.
  - [x] 1.1.1 Extend `ai_clean/git_helpers.py` (or sibling module) with `get_diff_stat(include_staged: bool = True) -> str`.
  - [x] 1.1.2 Shell out to `git diff --stat` for working-tree changes and, when `include_staged` is True, append the `git diff --stat --cached` output so staged edits are included as well.
  - [x] 1.1.3 Trim trailing whitespace and return "(no changes)" when both commands report nothing.
- [x] 1.2 Return summary for display after apply steps.
  - [x] 1.2.1 Provide a small formatter (e.g., prefix with "Changes:\n") so CLI callers can print the result directly.
  - [x] 1.2.2 On any git failure (e.g., not a repository, command error), raise `RuntimeError` that includes the command and stderr; do not swallow errors inside the helper.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure helper is read-only and does not modify git state.
  - [x] 1.3.1 Unit-test `get_diff_stat` with monkeypatched subprocess calls to prove it never invokes write operations (`git add`, `git commit`, etc.).
  - [x] 1.3.2 Add a negative test verifying that when git reports "not a git repository" the helper raises, and document that callers may catch this to show a friendly message if desired (policy: helper raises; caller decides how to present it).
