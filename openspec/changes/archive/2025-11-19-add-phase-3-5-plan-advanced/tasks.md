## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create the advanced cleanup planner.
  - [x] 1.1.1 Add `ai_clean/planners/advanced.py` with `plan_advanced_cleanup(finding: Finding, *, max_files: int = 1, max_lines: int = 40) -> CleanupPlan` and expose it through `ai_clean/planners/__init__.py`.
  - [x] 1.1.2 Map `finding.metadata` (`"title"`, `"rationale"`, `"suggested_changes"`) into the plan `title`, `intent`, and `metadata`.
  - [x] 1.1.3 Steps must include (1) restate the suggested edit, (2) apply the change to the specific line span, (3) run focused verification (tests or lint).
- [x] 1.2 Enforce file/line caps inside the planner.
  - [x] 1.2.1 Validate the finding only touches `max_files`; if multiple files are listed, keep the first and move the rest into `metadata["deferred_files"]`.
  - [x] 1.2.2 Clip the `locations` span to `max_lines` (e.g., by truncating the end line) and store the original span in metadata so future plans can cover the remainder.
- [x] 1.3 Flag advisory status and guardrails.
  - [x] 1.3.1 Add `constraints` requiring reviewers to double-check intent, forbidding API/behavior changes outside the provided snippet, and explicitly stating "advisory-only".
  - [x] 1.3.2 Include `metadata["advisory"] = True` and `metadata["source_finding_id"] = finding.id` for traceability.
