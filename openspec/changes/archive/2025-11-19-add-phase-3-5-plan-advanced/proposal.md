## Why
Translate advisory advanced_cleanup suggestions into small, actionable plans.

## What Changes
- Create plans for advanced_cleanup findings that implement a single small improvement (e.g., simplify conditional, standardize naming, remove dead code).
- Limit files and lines touched per plan and keep changes local to provided locations.
- Keep plans advisory and easy to review.

## Impact
- Codex suggestions become scoped plans without sprawling diffs.
- Reviewers can assess small, well-bounded improvements.
