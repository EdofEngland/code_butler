## Why
Establish an installable ai-clean skeleton with documented CLI entrypoint and basic project hygiene.

## What Changes
- Initialize ai-clean Python packaging metadata and CLI entrypoint name.
- Add Python-focused .gitignore and README covering purpose plus listed commands /analyze, /clean, /annotate, /organize, /cleanup-advanced, /plan, /apply, /changes-review.
- Ensure the CLI help prints all commands even as placeholders.

## Impact
- Developers can install ai-clean and discover CLI usage from help output.
- Hygiene files prevent noisy artifacts in version control.
