## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create package skeleton (e.g., `ai_clean/__init__.py`) and define `pyproject.toml`/setup metadata with name `ai-clean`, version placeholder, and install requirements.
- [x] 1.2 Add console entrypoint `ai-clean` in packaging config that dispatches to a CLI module.
- [x] 1.3 Implement a CLI stub that registers placeholder commands `/analyze`, `/clean`, `/annotate`, `/organize`, `/cleanup-advanced`, `/plan`, `/apply`, `/changes-review` and emits help text.
- [x] 1.4 Add a Python-focused `.gitignore` capturing venv, __pycache__, build/dist artifacts, and editor cruft.
- [x] 1.5 Author README with project purpose and one-line descriptions for each listed command.
- [x] 1.6 Install package locally (editable is fine) and run `ai-clean --help` to confirm all placeholder commands appear in help output.
