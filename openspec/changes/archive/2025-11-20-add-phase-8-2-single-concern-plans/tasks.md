## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Define single-concern rule across planners.
  - [x] 1.1.1 Introduce a `PlanConcern` enum or similar helper in `ai_clean/planners/orchestrator.py` that maps each finding category to a single concern identifier.
  - [x] 1.1.2 Update each planner module to set `CleanupPlan.metadata["concern"]` based on the helper so downstream logic can reason about scope.
  - [x] 1.1.3 Add validation in `plan_from_finding` ensuring that the generated plan references only files consistent with its concern (e.g., same module when concern is `docstring`).
- [x] 1.2 Adjust planner logic to split or reject multi-topic plans.
  - [x] 1.2.1 For categories that currently bundle unrelated fixes (e.g., `organize_candidate` or `advanced_cleanup`), add logic that creates multiple `CleanupPlan` instances—one per concern—or raises `PlannerError` with guidance.
  - [x] 1.2.2 Ensure the CLI (`ai_clean/cli.py` plan/clean/annotate handlers) iterates over any returned list of plans and surfaces the reason when a finding is rejected as multi-concern.
  - [x] 1.2.3 Extend planner unit tests to cover both the split-plan path and the rejection path, verifying metadata explains the violation.
- [x] 1.3 Document the constraint for consistent usage.
  - [x] 1.3.1 Update README.md and `openspec/specs/ai-clean-planning/spec.md` to describe the single-concern requirement and give examples of acceptable vs. rejected plans.
  - [x] 1.3.2 Add CLI help text (e.g., in `ai_clean/cli.py` descriptions) mentioning that large findings may be split automatically when they span multiple concerns.
