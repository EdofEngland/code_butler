## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Implement docstring planners.
  - [x] 1.1.1 Create `ai_clean/planners/docstrings.py` with `plan_docstring_fix(finding: Finding) -> CleanupPlan` and export it via `ai_clean/planners/__init__.py`.
  - [x] 1.1.2 `plan_docstring_fix` must branch on `finding.category` (`missing_docstring` vs `weak_docstring`) to set the plan `title`/`intent` and capture the target symbol from `finding.metadata["symbol"]`.
  - [x] 1.1.3 Populate `steps` describing (1) read referenced code to summarize purpose, (2) draft a concise factual docstring (include params/returns as needed), and (3) insert/replace the docstring at the specified lines.
- [x] 1.2 Bake in behavior-neutral guidance.
  - [x] 1.2.1 Add a `DOCSTRING_CONSTRAINTS` tuple (e.g., "Do not rename symbols", "Document existing behavior only") and reuse it for all generated plans.
  - [x] 1.2.2 Fill `tests_to_run` with `["Run static docstring linters if available, otherwise run pytest"]` to signal verification without modifying behavior.
- [x] 1.3 Enforce scope boundaries.
  - [x] 1.3.1 Ensure each plan references at most one module or a small related cluster by collapsing multiple findings in the same file into a single `symbol_batch` metadata entry (max 3 symbols).
  - [x] 1.3.2 When more symbols exist, emit `metadata["remaining_symbols"]` so downstream tooling knows additional plans are required rather than expanding this plan.
