## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Establish file naming and serialization helpers.
  - [x] 1.1.1 Inside `ai_clean/spec_backends/openspec.py`, add `_build_spec_filename(spec: SpecChange) -> str` that returns `{spec.id}.openspec.yaml` (slugify invalid path characters).
  - [x] 1.1.2 Use `yaml.safe_dump` (PyYAML) to serialize the SpecChange payload to YAML with sorted keys and `default_flow_style=False` for readability.
  - [x] 1.1.3 Add tests/notes to ensure filenames are deterministic even when spec IDs contain `/` or spaces (replace with `-`).
  - [x] 1.1.4 Add `PyYAML` to `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` so `yaml.safe_dump` is available at runtime.
- [x] 1.2 Implement `write_spec`.
  - [x] 1.2.1 Extend `OpenSpecBackend` with `write_spec(self, spec: SpecChange, directory: str) -> str` that ensures `.ai-clean/specs` (or provided directory) exists and writes the YAML file using UTF-8.
  - [x] 1.2.2 Return the absolute path to the saved file so callers can log it, and store the same path in the SpecChange payload metadata if provided.
- [x] 1.3 Enforce one change per file.
  - [x] 1.3.1 Before writing, verify that the target filepath does not already exist; if it does, raise a descriptive error instructing the caller to use a unique plan/spec id.
  - [x] 1.3.2 Add lightweight validation that each SpecChange describes a single plan by checking the payload only contains one plan id/finding reference; raise `ValueError` if multiple identifiers are detected.
