## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 5.4 – Executor Factories
The ai-clean project MUST fulfill the deliverables for Phase 5.4 described in docs/butlerspec_plan.md to keep the ButlerSpec roadmap on track.

#### Scenario: Phase 5.4 complete
- **GIVEN** the team is executing 5 – Executors (Codex + Review)
- **WHEN** Phase 5.4 (Executor Factories) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides executor factories outputs covering: Implement factories:; Unsupported types → explicit, helpful errors.
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
