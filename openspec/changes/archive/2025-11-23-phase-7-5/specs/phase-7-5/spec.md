## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Phase 7.5 – `/annotate` Command
The ai-clean project MUST fulfill the deliverables for Phase 7.5 described in docs/butlerspec_plan.md to keep the ButlerSpec roadmap on track.

#### Scenario: Phase 7.5 complete
- **GIVEN** the team is executing 7 – CLI Commands
- **WHEN** Phase 7.5 (`/annotate` Command) is completed
- **THEN** the repository provides `/annotate` command outputs covering: `ai-clean annotate [PATH] [--mode missing|all]`:
- **AND** the work remains within ButlerSpec guardrails (one-plan-per-file, specs on disk, Codex executor).
