## 1. Deliverables

- [ ] For `missing_docstring` / `weak_docstring`:

  - [ ] Intent: Add or improve docstrings.

  - [ ] Steps:

    - [ ] Infer behavior from code.
    - [ ] Draft concise, factual docstring.
    - [ ] Insert/replace docstring.

  - [ ] Constraints:

    - [ ] No renames or behavior changes.
    - [ ] No fictional guarantees; docstrings must reflect existing behavior (or explicitly call out assumptions).

- [ ] Scope: plan per module or tight group of related symbols to keep small.
