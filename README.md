# ai-clean

`ai-clean` is a CLI toolkit to analyze a codebase, propose scoped cleanup plans, and optionally apply them in a structured way.

## Commands (placeholders for now)
- `/analyze`: scan a path and list findings.
- `/clean`: guided flow for common structural cleanups.
- `/annotate`: target missing or weak docstrings.
- `/organize`: suggest small file moves into clearer folders.
- `/cleanup-advanced`: surface advisory advanced cleanup ideas.
- `/plan`: generate a cleanup plan for a specific finding.
- `/apply`: apply a stored plan with the configured backend.
- `/changes-review`: summarize changes, risks, and test status.

Until implementations land, the commands print placeholder messages but are discoverable via `ai-clean --help`.
